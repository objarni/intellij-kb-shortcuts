PyCharm keyboard shortcuts
==========================

Since I'm using PyCharm quite a lot these days, I've noticed some issues with PyCharms sync-settings functionality, I want a place to document the shortcuts I've added or just use a lot.


Custom shortcuts
----------------
 * Ctrl + O = File -> Open (duh! This is the first editor/IDE/desktop software that has lacked open kb shortcut since I started using software in the 80's... very surprising!)
 * Ctrl + Alt + Shift + W = Close other editor windows (when browsing lots of code this is handy for focusing on one of them)
 * Ctrl + Shift + S = Run with coverage. Using this a lot when doing approval testing


Favorites
---------
 * Shift, Shift = Search everything. Really handy when unsure of what kb shortcut is used for something (also displays kb shortcut to the right of each option so learning builtin here)
 * Ctrl + Alt + Shift + L = Reformat file (or selection if present)
 * Ctrl + Alt + Shift + T = Refactor this (bring up refactoring menu)
 * Ctrl + D = Duplicate row. Equivalent to Ctrl + Shift + D in Sublime Text.
 * Alt + Shift + Up/Down = Move line up/down. Equivalent to Ctrl + Shift Up/Down in ST
 * Ctrl + Shift + Up/Down = Move statement(s) up/down. A bit buggy, but more 'codish' than moving raw text
 * Ctrl + W = Increase selection by surrounding cursor or previous selection in closest natural 'delimiter scope'
 * Alt + J = Select next occurance. This is similar to Sublime Text's Ctrl + D
 * Ctrl + Alt + Shift + J = Select all occurances. Possibly more Python-aware than ST's Alt + F3
 * Ctrl + J = Snippet menu. Basically using this for `if __name__ == '__main__':` only :)
 * Ctrl + Alt + S = Settings.
 * Alt + Left/Right = Switch to left/right editor tab.
 * Alt + 1 = Focus project window (bring it up if it's closed)
 * Alt + 4 = Focus Run Window (handy with programs using input(..))
 * Alt + 2,2 = Bring up and hide Favorites window, basically giving focus to editor window. To get back from project or run window quickly!
